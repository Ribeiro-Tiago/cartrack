We would like you to build a simple webpage that shows / lists the current Team users.

You should use the following endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users  to fake data.

Provide users the ability to search by name or email (and other attributes, optional).

Provide an easy way so that users can contact a Team member.

A user should be able to navigate the interface via keyboard.

The app will be responsive and render well on modern desktop browsers as well as mobile devices.

Don't use any CSS Frameworks, we want to see your hand written abilities.

You are free to use any the following JS libraries - React - but you don't have to.

We want to see that you are using a up-to-date stack (ES6 JS, HTML5, CSS3, â€¦)

It should be a simple task, mostly to show how you structure your code.
